The game is a survival game, where the player needs to make it to the other side of an island in the shortest amount of time possible.
The player has a character class, with an inventory, status (including day, health and distance left), and also the attribute to walk
and cover distance.
Each time, the player will be asked to choose from several options, including viewing their inventory, status, and moving forward.
The total distance until the end of the game is 50 miles, and each checkpoint is every 10 miles.
The player can move 5 miles at a time, and at each checkpoint the player has more options of what to do. For example, they can hunt,
buy supplies, or rest.
Uses while and for loops so that the player can choose more than one option each time they are presented with them.

I defined many funcitons that would run once the player reached a certain amount of distance left.
